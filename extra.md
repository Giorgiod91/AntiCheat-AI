creating methods to access player name from the demo video then i will extract the parts i need from the best pro player from the given demo to then use this as my example in my model to learn from the best to then later detect cheater

- extract data from the demos with demoparser2
- set guideline from pro player stats ( accuracy and so on)

#Goals:

- let the model (neural network) learn pattern from pro player
- be able to detect inhuman reaction time (pro player reaction time should set the standart of high reaction time)
- see if the model can see difference between a pro player and a cheater stat wise ( movement, accuracy and so on)
- get big data set to work with
- first test it with myself playing
